This page contains links to all homework assignments and solutions as they are posted for EE PMP 559: Data Science for Energy Systems. Homework assignments can be downloaded individually from (https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559)[https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559] or they can pulled via a Git client. Git is a version control tool for software engineering, but is great for making your code available to a broader audience. In industry, data science tasks are often focused on prototyping and informing the deployment of statistics-based algorithms in engineered and operational environments, so using Git makes sharing your code with software engineers easy and straightforward. If you've downloaded Git, to clone (initialize a repository and download) a repository from command line:

`chase@mycomputer:~/school$ git clone https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559`

When new assignments and solutions are released, all you need to do to update your repository is to use the 'pull' command inside the repository directory:

`chase@mycomputer:/schoo/ee559$ git pull`

If you'd prefer to use a GUI, there is a (desktop GitHub client)[https://desktop.github.com/] that makes cloning, pushing, and pulling repositories very straightforward.
