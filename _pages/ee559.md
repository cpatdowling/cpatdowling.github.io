This page contains links to all homework assignments and solutions as they are posted for [EE PMP 559: Data Science for Power Systems](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/teaching/EE559_2019). Homework assignments can be downloaded individually from [https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559](https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559) or they can pulled via a Git client. Git is a version control tool for software engineering, but is great for making your code available to a broader audience. If you've downloaded Git, to clone (initialize a repository and download) a repository from command line:

`chase@mycomputer:~/school$ git clone https://github.com/cpatdowling/ee559.git`

When new assignments and solutions are released, all you need to do to update your repository is to use the 'pull' command inside the repository directory:

`chase@mycomputer:/school/ee559$ git pull`

If you'd prefer to use a GUI, there is a [desktop GitHub client](https://desktop.github.com/) that makes cloning, pushing, and pulling repositories very straightforward.
