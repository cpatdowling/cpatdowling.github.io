I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington's department of Electrical and Computer Engineering under the advisement of [Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). My current research is in the application of machine learning to civil, infrastructural engineering primarily in transportation and energy. I am on educational leave from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory where I am a staff data scientist leveraging high performance computing in a broad portfolio of project work. 

I received a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2012. My undergraduate coursework included classical English and world literature. My graduate coursework has consisted of topology, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, as well as economics and entrepreneurship.

I am a former graduate fellow of the [Clean Energy Institute](https://www.cei.washington.edu/) which has helped fund my work on next-generation transportation networks and energy grids. I am 2019-20 Mark Torrance Foundation [Tech Due Diligence Analyst](https://www.cei.washington.edu/training/torrance-tech-due-diligence-program/) providing technical consulting services for E8 angel investments. I am also a member of the Pacific Science Center's [Communications Fellowship](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/fellowship/) where I've developed engineering mathematics exhibits for primary grades K-5 students on S-T flow graphs as well as 9-12 students on the Monty Hall problem.
