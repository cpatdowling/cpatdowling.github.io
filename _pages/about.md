I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington's department of Electrical and Computer Engineering under the advisement of [Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). My current research is in the application of machine learning to civil, infrastructural engineering primarily in transportation and energy. Previously I was a staff data scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory leveraging high performance computing in a broad portfolio of project work. 

I received a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2012. My undergraduate coursework included classical English and world literature. My graduate coursework has consisted of topology, combinatorial optimization, machine learning, as well as economics and entrepeneurship.
